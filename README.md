### Lesson Overview: 
1. Understand the anatomy of a constraint
2. Revisit some simple autolayout examples in storyboard
3. Translate storyboard constraints using three methods:
  1. `NSLayoutConstraint`
  2. `Visual Format Language` (VFL)
  3. `NSLayoutAnchor`
4. Look at some common errors 
5. View Debugger

---
### Lesson Objective:
Be as, and more, proficient using programmatic autolayout than using Storyboard.

### Why Programmatic? 
There's a lot of ways to answer this question:

- You'll 100% encounter it in your development careers
- It's better than storyboard constraints (personal opinion)
- Less git conflicts on your storyboard
- Its more powerful and flexible than using storyboards alone
- etc...

But practically, we've been talking this entire time about understanding a problem and deconstructing it into its atomic components. Laying out your views is using that same skillset, and doing it programmatically lets you better understand how your storyboard's components are constructed. Over time and with practice, you'll be able to "read" a mockup of an app as you would with code.

> I personally find it *much* easier to work with view programmatically than using the storyboard or nibs... I can follow my own logic, but sometimes I just don't understand why storyboard does something. And because there is no "picture" of the UI infront of me, I'm forced to sketch out my thoughts and carefully plan code.

### Frames & Autolayout
It used to be the case that you had to calculate exactly the position of your views using the iPhones coordinate system. Some developers prefer this, but overall you end up writing a lot of difficult-to-understand code as a result. There was one instance where I was asked to make some changes to the layout of something a co-developer had written. Here's an small example of some of their "simpler" code:

```swift
  public override func layoutSubviews() {
    super.layoutSubviews()
    
    var x, y, w, h: CGFloat
    x = 0.0; y = 0.0; w = 20.0; h = 20.0
    self.imageView.frame = CGRectMake(x, y, w, h)
    
    x = self.imageView.frame.maxX + 5.0; y = 0.0
    w = self.bounds.width - x; h = 20.0
    self.noteLabel.frame = CGRectMake(x, y, w, h)
    
    x = 0.0; y = self.bounds.maxY - self.imageView.frame.maxY;
    w = 110.0; h = self.bounds.maxY - y
    self.button.frame = CGRectMake(x, y, w, h)
  }
```

Can you tell what it does by just skimming the code? You'd have to be a pretty good liar to convince me that you could. But I can tell you that it is intended to dynamically size some UI elements (`imageView, noteLable, button`) based on the size of their super view. 

Regardless of readability, let's go back to my situation: I'm asked to make a design change to this view never having seen the code before. Not only do I need to piece out what this code does, I'll likely try to draw it out for myself on paper/whiteboard so I don't forget it all, along with adding comments to the code, then I'll have to decided how to make the changes I need without breaking the existing, delicate, layout code.

> What did I end up doing? I told my PM that it would take too much time for me to go through the code to make a design change and it would be better to have the original developer do it. He agreed after I showed him the code and explained the issue. Fortunately it was a low-priority change, but we may have been in a bad situation if it was a critical fix. 

Autolayout does away with having to calculate frames by being expressive in its relation to other views.

### Anatomy of a Constraint

![Formula - via Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Art/view_formula_2x.png)

A constraint is, in essences, a linear equation with the format: 

`item1.attribute = multiplier x item2.attribute + constant`

For example, if we were trying to arrange two buttons such that they are right next to each other, with `8pt` between them, we could write: 

`button2.leading = 1.0 x button1.trailing + 8.0`

And since constraints are equations, not assignments, we can reverse them so long as we invert the multiplier and constant:

`button1.trailing = 1.0 x button2.leading - 8.0`

But where did we get `.leading` and .`trailing` from? There's a [list](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/nslayoutattribute) we can check.

### Minimum Satisfiable Constraints
You need to ensure that you define a location and a size for your views, otherwise they are considered to be "ambiguous" and you will get warnings. 

---
### Constraint Priorities
It is sometimes not possible for Autolayout to satisfy all of the constraints you've coded in. At that point, Autolayout goes through the constraints and chooses one to break in order to satisfy *some* of the constraints. But you can also set up a value hierarchy of which constraints are required or optional by giving them a value between 1 - 1000, 1 being the lowest and 1000 meaning the constraint is required. 

If an optional constraint cannot be satisfied, it will just skip it and continue on to the rest. Generally, you can use the system defined priority values of `250` (low) `500` (medium) `750` (high) and `1000` (required).

### Content Hugging & Compression Resistance 

In short:
Content Hugging: how much you want to resist expanding (defaults to low/`250` because its better for content to expand than shrink if necessary)
Compression Resistance: how much you want to resist growing (defaults to `750`)

### Defining Constraints Programmatically

#### Layout Anchors (`NSLayoutAnchor`)
*"Layout anchors let you create constraints in an easy-to-read, compact format. - Apple*

#### `NSLayoutConstraint`
Incredibly long and tedious to write. Very difficult to read and interpret as well. 

#### Visual Format Language
Lets you express constraints using a string representation. 

1. Auto Layout prints constraints to the console using the visual format language; for this reason, the debugging messages look very similar to the code used to create the constraints.
2. The visual format language lets you create multiple constraints at once, using a very compact expression.
3. The visual format language lets you create only valid constraints.
4. The notation emphasizes good visualization over completeness. Therefore some constraints (for example, aspect ratios) cannot be created using the visual format language.
5. The compiler does not validate the strings in any way. You can discover mistakes through runtime testing only.

### Live Coding

Let's take a look at all three ways of defining a constraint programmatically!

### Bonus: Golden Ratio w/ Fib Sequence
See [The Designer's guide to the golden ratio](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/designers-guide-golden-ratio-12121546)

The Fibonacci sequence gets pretty close to the Golden Ration (1:1.618...). For this example, I'd like for you to step through the first few numbers in the sequence in order to draw out a `UIView` representation of the sequence for `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`

**Double bonus** if you can do this task without hard-coding each view's values. You may solve this anyway you see fit, recursively inclusive.
